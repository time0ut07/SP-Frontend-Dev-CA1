        <p>
            Freshman Orientation Day was undoubtedly one of the most memorable experience in my life. I could really see the efforts that the seniors put in to make the freshies comfortable and allowing us to familarise ourselves with the new environment. It was definitely a once in a lifetime experience for me and I hope to be able to do the same for the next batch of freshies.
